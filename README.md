### Learnings from the project

 I learn a wide application of Python and how it can be used in our daily life. In this project what i learned more was how to efficiently filter out a particular thing which was more important. 


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I went step by step, function by function . This helped mereach my desired output earlier and a bit easier.


### Challenges faced

 Managing the list so i had to go back and read about the list and its methods . And sometimes i got confused in intrupting the instructions . Having a clear mind is what all you need and oviously some external help too.
